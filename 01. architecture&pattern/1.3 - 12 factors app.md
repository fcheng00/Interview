## Introduction

In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:
- Use **declarative** formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
- Have a **clean contract** with the underlying operating system, offering **maximum portability** between execution environments;
- Are suitable for deployment on mordern cloud platform, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
- Minimize divergence between development an production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
- And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to aps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services(databases, queue, memory cache, etc).

## The Twelve Factors
- Codebase
  - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
- Dependencies
  - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
- Config
  - Store config in the environment
- Backing services
  - Treat backing services as attached resource
- Build, release, run
  - Strictly separate build and run stages
- Processes
  - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
- Port binding
  - Export services via port binding
- Concurrency
  - Scale out via the process model
- Disposibility
  - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
- Dev/Prod parity
  - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
- Logs
  - Treat logs as event streams
- Admin processes
  - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
