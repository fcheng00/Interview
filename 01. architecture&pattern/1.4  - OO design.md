## SOLID
S - Single Responsibility Principle: a class should have only one reason to change
O - Open/Close Principle: software entities(class, modules, functions) should be open for extention, but closed for modification
L - Liskov's Substitution Principle: Derived or child class should be substitutable for their base or parent classes
I - Interface Segregation Principle: Do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them
D - Dependency Inversion Principle: 
- High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions
